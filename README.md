EV Efficiency & Range Prediction Dashboard

This project combines Python-based data analysis with Power BI visualization to explore the efficiency and performance of electric vehicles (EVs) using physics-based calculations.

Project Summary

I developed a complete data workflow to evaluate EV performance using real-world metrics derived from physical formulas.

- In Python: Cleaned the dataset, applied physics-based formulas, and calculated energy losses, range, and efficiency metrics.

- In Power BI: Built an interactive dashboard to visualize EV performance by model, efficiency, and energy loss sources.

Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – for data processing and physics calculations

- Power BI – for data modeling and dashboard creation

- GitHub – to document and share the analysis workflow

Dataset

The dataset includes calculated fields such as:

- Drag & rolling resistance losses

- Predicted and adjusted driving range

- Energy efficiency (kWh per km)

- Comparative performance between car types and manufacturers

No missing data is present — all vehicles include full calculated metrics.

 Key Insights

- Quantified the impact of drag and rolling resistance on EV range.

- Identified top-performing EVs by energy efficiency and design.

- Created a physics-informed model linking vehicle specs to real-world range.

Results

Clean, physics-enhanced dataset exported as CSV (ev_efficiency_data.csv)

Interactive Power BI dashboard highlighting:

- Most efficient EVs

- Drag and rolling resistance losses

- Correlation between weight, battery size, and adjusted range
